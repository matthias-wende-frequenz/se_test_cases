# Test Cases for Siemens Energy HiL System

## Set up grafana for truck charging monitoring

To start Grafana and influxdb3, run the script in the `scripts` directory:

Run the following command to create the initial admin token for InfluxDB 3 and
safe the token.

```sh
podman exec -ti influxdb3 influxdb3 create token --admin
```

As a next step, you need to create a datasource in Grafana.

### Maintainance of the InfluxDB 3 database

Make sure to set the environment variable `INFLUXDB3_AUTH_TOKEN` to the token you created above.

To delete the database `electrical_monitoring` and all its tables, run the following command:

```sh
podman exec -e INFLUXDB3_AUTH_TOKEN -ti influxdb3 influxdb3 delete table --database electrical_monitoring power_metrics
```

## Create snap

Note: The python snapcraft plugin doesn't support cross-compilation, 
so the snap must be built on the target architecture.

To create a snap from a python project that uses `pyproject.toml`, is this project, file we need 
to use Snapcraft from the edge channel [2].

```
sudo snap refresh snapcraft --edge
```

Running the app in the snap works by running an auto created run script as defined in the pyproject.toml
file [1].
